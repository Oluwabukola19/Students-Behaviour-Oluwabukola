RECOMMENDATIONS

1.Scholarship should be given to the student, from his performance i believe the student will perform well if given the scholarship.

2.Scholarship should be increased and the sum of grade be looked into very well to confirm the grade really captures the student's work.

3.The student should be called to order to see why he or she is not taking notes, why the reading frequency, study hours and attending classes is below average.

4.Scholarship should be withdrawn from the students and be given a close monitoring.
